## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **System Identification and PID Controller Design** for the EN2143 Electronic Control Systems course at the University of Moratuwa. The project demonstrates system identification techniques using MATLAB's System Identification Toolbox and subsequent PID controller design for the identified system.

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Generate input-output data for a given third-order plant
- Estimate plant transfer function using System Identification App
- Compare estimated vs actual model performance
- Design and tune PID controller for improved system performance
- Analyze closed-loop vs open-loop system responses
